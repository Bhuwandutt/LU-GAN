3006,melanoma,cardiomegaly is present the pulmonary vascularity appears within normal limits thoracic aorta is tortuous patient is status post sternotomy surgical clips are present in the left axilla lungs are free of focal airspace disease no pneumothorax or pleural effusion is seen there is eventration of the right hemidiaphragm degenerative changes are present in the spine,no evidence of active disease,1,55,5
3188,this is a male patient with vomiting history of varices and previous complaints of chest pain,no findings,the cardiac silhouette appears be at upper limits of normal to borderline enlarged the mediastinum and parahilar structures are also slightly prominent but unchanged portacatheter is noted with its tip in superior this appears unchanged slightly inspiratory effort is noted on the frontal film this is unchanged osseous structures appear be grossly unremarkable no pneumothorax or obvious pulmonary lesions seen,16,2,60
563,rib pain,the examination consists of frontal and lateral radiographs of the chest cardiac silhouette is at top limits of normal aortic and mediastinal contours are within normal limits pulmonary vascularity is within normal limits no focal consolidation pleural effusion or pneumothorax identified partially visualized orif involving the left proximal humerus deformity of the left distal clavicle compatible with remote no displaced rib fractures on this chest examination,no evidence of acute cardiopulmonary process,2,66,6
550,elevated wbc,no findings,normal heart size normal pulmonary vasculature normal mediastinal contours lung parenchyma is clear no airspace disease no pulmonary edema no of pleural effusions no of active cardiopulmonary disease unchanged,2,2,29
3567,status post pacemaker implantation,and lateral chest examination was obtained the heart silhouette and mediastinal contours are not enlarged pacemaker leads are within the right atrium and ventricle lungs demonstrate there is right lower lobe airspace disease and small effusion suspicious for pneumonia left lung is clear there is no pneumothorax,right lower lobe airspace disease and small effusion probably representing pneumonia,4,47,11
3699,female starting methotrexate,normal heart size mediastinal contours no focal airspace consolidation no pleural effusion or pneumothorax degenerative disc disease in the thoracic spine with osteophyte formation bridging,no acute cardiopulmonary abnormalities,3,25,4
332,x concern for left lower lobe pneumonia on physical exam,there are are streaky retrocardiac left lower lobe opacities in the correct clinical setting this could represent a pneumonia there is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion the cardiac silhouette is within normal limits,streaky left retrocardiac airspace opacities in the correct clinical setting this could represent a pneumonia,10,33,15
3038,status post mva,the heart and mediastinum are unremarkable there is a calcified granuloma within the left upper lobe the lungs are clear without infiltrate there is no effusion or pneumothorax there are acute mild anterior deformities identified at ll there is retropulsion of the posterior vertebral body of l a ct of the lumbar spine was already ordered at the time of this dictation,no acute cardiopulmonary disease acute anterior deformities at ll please see ct of the lumbar spine for further details,3,62,19
2998,woman with chest,the lungs are clear bilaterally specifically no evidence of focal consolidation pneumothorax or pleural effusion cardio mediastinal silhouette is unremarkable visualized osseous structures of the thorax are without acute abnormality no displaced rib fractures identified,no acute cardiopulmonary abnormality,3,35,4
2855,with chest pain,the lungs are clear bilaterally specifically no evidence of focal consolidation pneumothorax or pleural effusion cardio mediastinal silhouette is unremarkable visualized osseous structures of the thorax are without acute abnormality,no acute cardiopulmonary abnormality,3,30,4
8,with on dyspnea history of mitral valve prolapse,the heart pulmonary and mediastinum are within normal limits there is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax there is no focal air space opacity to suggest a pneumonia there is an interim cervical spinal fusion partly evaluated,no acute cardiopulmonary disease,8,36,4
3813,wheezing,there is opacity left lung base may represent atelectasis or early infiltrate the cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits no pneumothorax or pleural effusion,opacity left lung base,1,24,4
3668,history of asthma further history from the ordering physician states that the patient has a productive and symptoms of pneumonia,no findings,heart size is normal right lung clear there is a cm nodular infiltrate in left midlung this could represent pneumonia or a tumor recommend followup radiology until clear,20,2,28
275,chest pain dyspnea,lungs are clear bilaterally there is no focal consolidation pleural effusion or pneumothoraces cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits are unremarkable,no acute cardiopulmonary abnormality,3,21,4
1147,no indication,no findings,no impression,2,2,2
2322,chronic,lung volumes remain opacity is present in the right middle lobe no focal infiltrates heart size normal,continued hypoinflation with right middle lobe focal atelectasis,1,17,8
3124,male with history of pulmonary embolism,there is persistent marked enlargement of the pulmonary arteries normal heart size no focal airspace consolidation no pleural effusion or pneumothorax visualized osseous structures are unremarkable in appearance,enlarged pulmonary arteries this may be due to previous chronic pulmonary embolism or pulmonary arterial hypertension no evidence of pneumonia or other acute cardiopulmonary abnormality,6,28,25
1750,female with chest pain,the heart size is within normal limits after cirrhotic calcification of the thoracic aorta hyperexpanded lungs with flattened diaphragms and increased retrosternal clear space suggestive of emphysema streaky left basilar opacities are favored to represent scarring no pleural effusions or pneumothorax exaggerated thoracic kyphosis scattered calcified granulomas bilaterally no acute bony abnormalities,no acute cardiopulmonary findings chronic changes of emphysema and left basilar scarring,4,52,12
1373,chest pain,the lungs are clear there is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax the heart is not significantly enlarged there are atherosclerotic changes of the aorta arthritic changes of the skeletal structures are noted,no acute pulmonary disease,2,32,4
12,No Indication,lungs are clear bilaterally cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are normal pulmonary vasculature is normal no pneumothorax or pleural effusion no acute bony abnormality,no acute cardiopulmonary abnormality,1,23,4
