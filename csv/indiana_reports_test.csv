2974,male with esophageal dyskinesia esophageal surgery performed weeks ago,postsurgical changes are noted in the mediastinum there is tortuosity and or ectasia of the thoracic and upper abdominal aorta no consolidative airspace opacities blunting of the lateral and posterior left costophrenic sulcus may represent residual postsurgical effusion or pleural parenchymal scarring no demonstrable pneumothorax cardiomediastinal silhouette within normal limits multilevel anterior osteophytes of the thoracic spine,small left basilar parenchymal scarring and or effusion postsurgical changes of the mediastinum otherwise unremarkable chest radiograph,9,57,17
910,with osteoarthritis of the left hip preop evaluation for hip replacement,the heart size is moderately enlarged there is evidence of previous aortic valve replacement sternotomy are grossly intact the pulmonary and mediastinum are within normal limits there is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax there are chronically increased interstitial lung markings without superimposed focal airspace disease identified there are degenerative changes of the spine,cardiomegaly without superimposed acute disease noted,11,53,6
1138,male testicular cancer,no pleural effusions no pneumothorax no focal areas of consolidation heart size within normal limits osseous structures intact,no acute cardiopulmonary abnormality,3,18,4
2060,female chest pain,there is prominence of the left hilum which may represent adenopathy or engorged vasculature cardiac silhouette is within normal limits of size and contour no pneumothorax or large pleural effusion no acute bone abnormality,prominence of the left hilum may be secondary to adenopathy or enlarged pulmonary vasculature chest ct with contrast may be helpful for further clarification,3,34,24
494,female breast cancer preoperative evaluation,heart size within normal limits mediastinal contours unremarkable pulmonary vascularity is normal right lung is clear opacities left lung base may represent atelectasis versus scarring no focal consolidation no pleural effusion no pneumothorax bony structures unremarkable,atelectasis versus scar left lung base otherwise unremarkable for the opportunity to assist in the care of your patient if there are any questions about this examination please certified radiologist at,5,36,31
920,post thoracic pain,heart size is normal cardiomediastinal contour is normal without mediastinal widening lungs are clear bilaterally no pleural effusions or pneumothorax no bony or soft tissue abnormalities,no acute cardiopulmonary abnormality,3,26,4
3936,male of breath,heart size within normal limits no alveolar consolidation no findings of pleural effusion or pulmonary edema no pneumothorax,no acute cardiopulmonary findings,3,18,4
188,status post right thoracentesis,no findings,no residual right pleural effusion identified status post thoracentesis no pneumothorax mediastinum cardiac size grossly stable small to moderate left sided pleural effusion increased compared to prior chest radiograph left lung base atelectasis airspace disease,4,2,35
922,No Indication,the heart is slightly large pulmonary are normal no infiltrates,slight cardiomegaly with no failure or pneumonia,1,10,7
1841,cxr for placement s p calc fx and distal tibia fx,the heart and lungs have in the interval both lungs are clear and expanded heart and mediastinum normal,no active disease,11,18,3
2662,and wheezing,the heart is normal in size the mediastinum is unremarkable the lungs are clear,no acute disease,2,14,3

961,male acute iritis no chest complaints,there is a opacity projecting over the left midlung posterior on the lateral view no pleural effusions no evidence of pneumothorax heart size top normal degenerative changes thoracic spine,opacity projecting over the left midlung comparison examinations would be useful if no comparison examinations exist would be helpful for further evaluation,6,29,22
1946,dizziness and hand numbness,portable frontal view of the chest with overlying external cardiac monitor leads shows normal cardiomediastinal silhouette central airways pulmonary vasculature and lung volumes without focal air space consolidation or pleural effusion,no acute intrathoracic disease,4,31,4
1295,wheezing,low lung volumes are present the heart size and pulmonary vascularity appear within normal limits the lungs are free of focal airspace disease no pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen mild degenerative changes are present in the spine,no evidence of active disease,1,38,5
