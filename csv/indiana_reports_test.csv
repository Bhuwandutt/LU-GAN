3749,chest pain,lungs are clear bilaterally cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are normal pulmonary vasculature is normal no pneumothorax or pleural effusion no acute bony abnormality,no acute cardiopulmonary abnormality,2,23,4
3680,and,the heart is normal in size and contour there is no mediastinal widening streaky bibasilar opacities atelectasis vague opacity in the right midlung scattered calcified granulomas no large pleural effusion or pneumothorax the are intact,vague opacity in the right midlung this could reflect a small focus of atelectasis or infiltrate bibasilar airspace opacities atelectasis,1,35,20
3915,seizure,there is a in the left chest with catheter tip terminating in the superior the cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged similar to prior study there is minimal pulmonary vascular congestion there is no acute pulmonary consolidation pleural effusion or pneumothorax there are stable mild interstitial lung changes which could be related to chronic edema or fibrosis,stable cardiomegaly no acute infiltrate or effusion,1,56,7
3678,hx of prostate kidney cancer copd,the heart is normal in size the mediastinum is unremarkable the costophrenic are blunted the interstitial markings are slightly accentuated suggesting underlying chronic disease emphysema no focal consolidation is seen,mild costophrenic blunting suggesting bilateral pleural effusions and or thickening no acute infiltrate,6,30,13
2375,female with,cardiac silhouette is upper limits of normal in size normal mediastinal contour and pulmonary vasculature there is evidence of healed granulomatous disease in the right hemithorax lungs are without focal airspace consolidation large pleural effusion or pneumothorax,no acute cardiopulmonary findings,2,37,4
1049,chest pain that started ealier today non radiating pain shortness of breath x weeks pain in joints x weeks mostly right side non no hx ca no previous heart or lung conditions,no findings,comparison well expanded and clear lungs mediastinal contour within normal limits no acute cardiopulmonary abnormality identified,32,2,16
587,male suspected pneumonia,the cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits for appearance no focal areas of pulmonary consolidation no interval change in the appearance of the opacities in the bilateral lower lobes no pneumothorax no pleural effusion the thoracic spine appears intact,no interval change in the appearance of the opacities in the bilateral lower lobes,3,39,14
952,No Indication,the heart size and pulmonary vascularity appear within normal limits the lungs are free of focal airspace disease no pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen calcified granuloma are noted a few opacities are present consistent with of scarring or atelectasis,a few basilar of opacity this may represent scarring or atelectasis,1,40,11
2181,with dyspnea,heart size is moderately enlarged the pulmonary and mediastinum are within normal limits there is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax there is suspected right lower lobe airspace opacity demonstrated on the lateral study there is a fracture of superior sternotomy unchanged,possible right lower lobe pneumonia cardiomegaly,2,41,6
3919,left false rib,no findings,slight cardiomegaly lungs are clear no rib abnormalities are seen the lower ribs are not adequately imaged to rule out pathology on the chest film,3,2,25
1472,male with shortness of breath and,normal cardiac contour clear hyperexpanded lungs bilaterally with no pneumothorax or pleural effusion,no acute cardiopulmonary abnormalities,6,13,4
1245,female heart palpitations,no findings,cardiomegaly aortic ectasia tortuosity cardiomediastinal silhouette appears similar to prior no focal alveolar consolidation no definite pleural effusion seen no typical findings of pulmonary edema,3,2,25
3843,male with a prior history of throat cancer and radiation presents with reported hemoptysis,a right sided chest remains in with the distal tip at the level of the mid svc the cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits for appearance no focal areas of pulmonary consolidation no pulmonary nodules or mass lesions identified no pneumothorax or pleural effusion mild degenerative changes of the thoracic spine,right sided chest in without demonstration of an acute cardiopulmonary abnormality,14,51,11
